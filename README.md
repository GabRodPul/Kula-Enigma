# Kula-Enigma
Unity game using the Roll a ball tutorial as a base

# About the game
## How to play (Keyboard/Controller)
- WASD/Left Joystick: Move around
- Spacebar/South Button: Jump
- Ctrl/West Button: Change Camera
- Esc/Start: Pause or unpause the game
- Move Mouse/Right Joystick: Rotate the ball (does absolutely nothing, tried to use it to move the camera around but gave up. Looks funny tho.)

## Scenes
### Main Menu
Start a New Game or Select a level.
When starting a new game, you'll go through all the levels and accumulate points from one level to another (check out the Globals.cs script for more information).

![main-menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103140108/216694384-00c0a10b-d11f-4acc-abaf-8d8024060cc1.png)

After finishing a Level opened from the Level Select, you'll return to the Main Menu.

### Level 1
First level. Literally the first screen of the Roll a ball tutorial.
This and the second level require you to collect all the pickups to activate the exit.
After all pickups have been collected, the text will disappear, too.

You can change the camera from a close camera, to isometric camera and a bird's eye view camera. Only useful on this level or maybe level 2, really.

### Level 2
A long hallway in the backrooms that requires memorisation.
Designed it as a way to help the player understand how the ball physics and momentum work.
Muscular memory is the key here.

### Level 3
It seems that Vieja Firgas has been completely drowned by the horrors found in Nueva Firgas...
Take advantage of the ball's physics and accumulate momentum to clear huge gaps!
It also features 3D Blender models!

### Level 4
Whoops... it seems like someone's angry.


### End 
This screen is displayed after you beat the 4th level. It shows your total run score.


# Extra Twenty Percent
For the extra 20%;
- I made some 3D models using Blender. They can be found inside the Models folder:

- ????.????.???? Appears is a remix of Odio's Theme from Live a Live. I made it using this [MIDI](https://www.vgmusic.com/music/console/nintendo/snes/live-a-live_-_the_demon_king_odio.mid), and this [SoundFont](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1388)
